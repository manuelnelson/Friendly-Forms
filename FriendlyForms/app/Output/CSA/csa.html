                the children who are subject to this child support determination is served by deviation from the presumptive amount of child support.

                        (a) An Income Deduction Order shall be entered by the Court, under OCGA § 19-6-32, for
                    payment of the child support and alimony (if any) provided. The Income Deduction Order shall take 
                    effect:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p class="checkbox">
                                <input class="form-control" type="checkbox" disabled="disabled" />
                                (1) immediately upon entry by the Court.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="checkbox">
                                <input class="form-control" type="checkbox" disabled="disabled" />
                                (2) upon accrual of a delinquency equal to one month’s support. The Income Deduction Order 
                            may be enforced by serving a “Notice of Delinquency,” as provided in OCGA §19-6-32 (f).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="checkbox">
                        <input class="form-control" type="checkbox" disabled="disabled" />
                        (b) The parties agree that an Income Deduction Order is not immediately necessary.

                        (c) The Court finds that there is good cause not to require income deduction, having determined
                    that income deduction will not serve the children’s best interests and that there has been sufficient 
                    proof of timely payment of any previously ordered support.
